Get Started
"StreamFlix, a rapidly growing video streaming platform, has observed fluctuations in user engagement since the onboarding of several new customers in June. To enhance customer retention and boost usage, they have provided you with a user interaction dataset for August containing user platform visit and watch timer data for the new customers onboarded in June. Your task is to conduct a detailed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to understand user behavior better on 1st Sept 2024."
Objective
"The company aims to identify distinct customer segments based on their engagement levels, allowing for targeted marketing strategies. Key areas to focus on in your analysis include:
Recency: How recently have customers interacted with StreamFlix? Are newer customers more engaged than long-term users?
Frequency: How often do customers watch content? Which segments demonstrate high engagement versus those that are less active?
Monetary: What is the average spending of different customer segments? Are higher-paying customers more likely to remain active?

Based on the findings from the RFM analysis, personalized messages will be sent to each customer segment as defined in the Segment Table sheet, which contains tailored messaging strategies for different customer profiles."
Data
"You have been provided with the following datasets:

UserInteractionTable: User's platform visit data.
